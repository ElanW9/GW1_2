                <h1>The life of Van Gogh.</h1>
                <p>
                    Van Gogh was a Dutch post-Impressionist artist. He is one of the
                    most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art.
                    His artworks include oil paintings, watercolors, drawings, and
                    sketches. Van Gogh was born into an upper-middle-class family in
                    1853 in the village of Groot-Zundert in the province of North
                    Brabant in the southern Netherlands. He was the eldest son of
                    Theodorus van Gogh, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and
                    Anna Cornelia Carbentus. When he was just 16 years old, his father
                    gave him a position at the art dealing firm Goupil & Cie in The
                    Hague. This was a happy time for Vincent as he was able to explore
                    his love for art without the pressure of having to produce saleable
                    work. However, in 1876, after two years at Goupil's, Vincent was
                    transferred to the company's branch in London, where he fell in love
                    with his landlady's daughter, Elizabeth."Bessie" Reuters. Despite
                    Vincent's objections, his father set him up with a position at the
                    Paris branch of Goupil's in late 1873. Vincent was miserable in
                    Paris and longed to return to the Netherlands. In 1879, after again
                    becoming distraught over a love affair, Vincent quit his job at
                    Goupil's and decided to become an artist.
